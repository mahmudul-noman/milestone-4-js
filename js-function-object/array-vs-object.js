// array vs object writing diffeence


/**
ARRAY:
We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list. Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data type (as well as an array or another object), so too can arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.

// Array Write like that
var shopping_Items = ['books', 'sunglass', 'shoes', 'pen'];
var friends_age = [24, 25, 22, 28, 23];




/*
OBJECT:
Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.

var friends_age = {
    soton: 24,
    noman: 25,
    mamun: 11,
    mizan: 28,
